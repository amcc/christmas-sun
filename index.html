      <h1>Christmas Sun</h1>

        <p>
          Christmas time is a celebration of life, just after the sun reaches
          its lowest point.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christmas tree is an evergreen, it is one of the few plants to
          remain constant all year round and perhaps reminds us that life
          carries on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This model shows the position of the sun every month on the 21st day.
          December 21st is the shortest day and June 21st is the longest day in
          Northern Europe (the models shows the positions in Edinburgh, or the
          same latitude elsewhere).

            onto a table or floor and moving around the artwork. On a desktop

        <h2>About this artwork</h2>
        <p>
          Each vertical column has a large hole at the top which you can look
          through, or shine a light through to experience the angle of the sun
          in Edinburgh during the year (56 Â° latitude). There are a number of
          small holes at the base of each vertical to represent the month, from
          1 - 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to experience the angle of the sun in December look through
          the hole on the shortest column towards the tree, this column has 12
          small holes at its base. Looking through the hole at the top of the
          tallest column, which represents June 21st, shows the angle of the sun
          on the longest day of the year, this column has 6 small holes at its
          base. In this way you can experience the suns progression throughout
          the year in Edinburgh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edinburgh is the latitude where the artist lives, it's also on a
          latitude that represents the experience of many in northern parts of
          Europe, a place with very little sun in winter and a lot of sun in
          summer. As humans we experience things in the moment, by viewing the
          sun's position over a whole year you can experience a more holistic
          view of time and place.

          This artwork is available as a 3D printed model, which is assembled as
          a kit and a plotted drawing.
