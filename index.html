    <h1>Christmas Sun</h1>
    <p>
      Christmas time is a celebration of life, just after the sun reaches its
      lowest point.
    </p>
    <p>
      This model shows the position of the sun every month on the 21st day.
      December 21st is the shortest day and Junw 21st is the longest day. The
      angles of the sun are from Edinburgh (or the same latitude elsewhere).
    </p>
    <p>
      A Christmas tree is an evergreen, it is one of the few plants to remain
      constant all year round and perhaps reminds us that life carries on.
