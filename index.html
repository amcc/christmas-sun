      <h1>Christmas Sun</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Christmas time is a celebration of life, just after the sun reaches
          its lowest point.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Christmas tree is an evergreen, it is one of the few plants to
          remain constant all year round and perhaps reminds us that life
          carries on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This model shows the position of the sun every month on the 21st day.
          December 21st is the shortest day and June 21st is the longest day.
          The angles of the sun are from Edinburgh (or the same latitude
          elsewhere).

        <h2>About this artwork</h2>
        <p>
          Each vertical column has a hole which you can look through, or shine a
          light through to experience the angle of the sun in Edinburgh (or at
          56 Â° latitude) during the year. There are a number of small holes at
          the base of each vertical to represent the month, from 1 - 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ediburgh is used as a basis for the latitude as that is where the
          artist lives, it's also on a latitude that represents the experience
          of many in northern parts of Europe, a place with very little sun in
          winter, but a lot of sun in summer. As humans we experience things in
          the moment, but viewing in one model the sun over a whole year you can
          experience something very interesting about our position on the globe.

          This artwork is also available as a 3D printed model and a plotted
          drawing.
